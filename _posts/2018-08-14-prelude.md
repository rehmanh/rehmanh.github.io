Welcome! I used to have more words in this prelude post, but that post was too stale (and too cringe!). This is a programming blog, but I will try to treat it like a programming "diary". Yes, I know GitHub and Gists already exist for exactly that purpose. But I like Jekyll, and I like Ruby and this platform just gives me more of an excuse to use these tools. It will also (hopefully) force me to be intentional about what I think is important, and what I think might be valuable information for other people to have. Posts shall try to be as short and sweet as possible, while still being thorough.
