My name is Habib ur Rehman and I am a software engineering student at the University of Wisconsin – Eau Claire. I also work as a Ruby
on Rails developer at my university, creating and maintaining need-based and department-specific applications.

Most of what I know comes from things I have learned at school, at work and from personal projects. Topics I am interested in
include (but are not limited to): application development, web development and programming langugage theory.

I enjoy drinking coffee, going for long drives and cooking. I'm also a huge music lover.
