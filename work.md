Here are some personal projects that I have worked on. All of them are open source, so if you're interested in something, feel free 
to check it out on my Github.

### <span class="internal-link">[ReviewBot](https://github.com/rehmanh/ReviewBot)<span>

Android application that uses sentiment-analysis and pattern-matching to score user's movie reviews. Users can enter the reviews of movies
that they have seen recently and ReviewBot will analyze word patterns and sentiments to project an estimate score for their review. The 
idea for this concept came from <span class="internal-link">[this Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews)</span>.

### <span class="internal-link">[Mac-Screen-Time](https://github.com/rehmanh/Mac-Screen-Time)

Apple's Darwin doesn't really provide an out-of-the-box solution for logging screen usage time or statistics for Mac. This Ruby script 
does. If you're wondering how much time you've spent on your Mac in a given day, for a given power cycle or since it's last wake, use 
this script to make screen time logging easier. Works on any Mac with Ruby. The concept was inspired by Android's native 
"Screen usage since last full charge" statistic.

### <span class="internal-link">[Aesthetic Clinic](https://github.com/rehmanh/Aesthetic-Clinic)</span>

A Rails application created for Dr. Obaid's Aesthetic Clinic. Patient privacy and data security are the core of this application.
